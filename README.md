This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

Gesticoliamo is an experimental application created for demonstration purposes to illustrate one of the many potential applications of artificial intelligence, namely the recognition of hand gestures.

Having been created in a few days, the purpose of this application was not to create a complete and optimized project, but to explore, by way of example, a use case to be explored in the future.

## How it works

From the initial menu it is possible to access the Play area where the user can try to compose some sentences with gestures. In the Learn area the user learns some basic gestures. In the Tutorial area, a brief description indicates how to use gesture recognition in the two sections of the app.

## Libraries used

- TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/):  is a machine learning library developed by Google to build, train, and deploy AI models. TensorFlow offers a wide range of tools, modules and algorithms that simplify the process of developing machine learning models
In the context of hand gesture recognition TensorFlow can be used to train a model that recognizes and interprets different finger poses and hand movements

-Fingerpose: is a specific library based on TensorFlow.js that focuses on hand finger pose recognition. This library exploits the power of TensorFlow.js to detect and track finger poses in real time using the camera.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
